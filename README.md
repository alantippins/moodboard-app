As creators, we often begin with a single word or concept. Verbal helps bridge the gap between that initial spark and a full creative direction by providing instant visual and sensory inspiration.

Designers, writers, and musicians often start with a **feeling**—Verbal lets you *interface with feeling*.  
It's a creative toy with professional applications:

- Moodboard starter  
- Naming exercise  
- Brand tone exploration  
- Visual tone-of-voice prototype
